<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 13"><h1>Robust and
  Stochastic Control</h1>
  
  <p>So far in the notes, we have concerned ourselves with only known,
  deterministic systems.  In this chapter we will begin to consider uncertainty.
  This uncertainy can come in many forms... we may not know the governing
  equations (e.g. the coefficient of friction in the joints), our robot may be
  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNZPRsrwumQ?t=32">walking on unknown terrain,
  subject to unknown disturbances</a>, or even be picking up unknown objects.
  There are a number of mathematical frameworks for considering this
  uncertainty; for our purposes this chapter will generalizing our thinking to
  equations of the form: $$\dot\bx = {\bf f}(\bx, \bu, \bw, t) \qquad \text{or}
  \qquad \bx[n+1] = {\bf f}(\bx[n], \bu[n], \bw[n], n),$$ where $\bw$ is a new
  <i>random</i> input signal to the equations capturing all of this potential
  variability. Although it is certainly possible to work in continuous time, and
  treat $\bw(t)$ as a continuous-time random signal (c.f. <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Wiener process</a>), it is
  notationally simpler to work with $\bw[n]$ as a discrete-time random signal.
  For this reason, we'll devote our attention in this chapter to the
  discrete-time systems.</p>

  <p>In order to simulate equations of this form, or to design controllers
  against them, we need to define the random process that generates $\bw[n]$. It
  is typical to assume the values $\bw[n]$ are independent and identically
  distributed (i.i.d.), meaning that $\bw[i]$ and $\bw[j]$ are uncorrelated when
  $i \neq j$.  As a result, we typically define our distribution via a
  probability density $p_{\bf w}(\bw[n])$.  This is not as limiting as it may
  sound... if we wish to treat temporally-correlated noise (e.g. "colored
  noise") the format of our equations is rich enough to support this by adding
  additional state variables; we'll give an example below of a "whitening
  filter" for modeling wind gusts.  The other source of randomness that we will
  now consider in the equations is randomness in the initial conditions; we will
  similarly define a probabilty density $p_\bx(\bx[0]).$</p>

  <p>This modeling framework is rich enough for us to convey the key ideas; but
  it is not quite sufficient for all of the systems I am interested in.  In
  <drake></drake> we go to additional lengths to support more general cases of
  <a
  href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__stochastic__systems.html">stochastic
  systems</a>.  This includes modeling system parameters that are drawn from
  random each time the model is initialized, but are fixed over the duration of
  a simulation; it is possible but inefficient to model these as additional
  state variables that have no dynamics.  In other problems, even the
  <i>dimension of the state vector</i> may change in different realizations of
  the problem!  Consider, for instance, the case of a robot manipulating random
  numbers of dishes in a sink. I do not know many control formulations that
  handle this type of randomness well, and I consider this a top priority to
  think more about!  (We'll begin to address it in the <a href="output_feedback.html">output feedback chapter</a>.)</p>
  
  <p>Roughly speaking, I will refer to "stochastic control" as the discipline of
  synthesizing controllers that govern the probabilistic evolution of the
  equations.  "Stochastic optimal control" defines a cost function (now a random
  variable), and tries to find controllers that optimize some metric such as the
  expected cost.  When we use the terms "robust control", we are typically
  referring to a class of techniques that try to guarantee a worst-case
  performance or a worst-case bound on the effect of randomness on the input on
  the randomness on the output.  Interestingly, for many robust control
  formulations we do not attempt to know the precise probability distribution of
  $\bx[0]$ and $\bw[n]$, but instead only define the <i>sets</i>
  of possible values that they can take.  This modeling is powerful, but can
  lead to conservative controllers and pessimistic estimates of performance.</p>

  <section><h1>Discrete states and actions</h1>

    <p> One of the most amazing features of the dynamic programming, additive
    cost approach to optimal control is the relative ease with which it extends
    to optimizing stochastic systems. </p>

    <subsection><h1>Graph search -- stochastic shortest path
    problems</h1>

      <p>For discrete systems, we can generalize our dynamics on a graph by
      adding action-dependent transition probabilities to the edges.  This new
      dynamical system is known as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and we write
      the dynamics completely in terms of the transition probabilities \[
      \Pr(s[n+1] = s' | s[n] = s, a[n] = a). \] For discrete systems, this is
      simply a big lookup table.  The cost that we incur for any execution of
      system is now a random variable, and so we formulate the goal of control
      as optimizing the expected cost, e.g. \begin{equation} J^*(s[0]) =
      \min_{a[\cdot]} E \left[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \ell(s[n],a[n]) \right].
      \label{eq:stochastic_dp_optimality_cond} \end{equation}  Note that there
      are many other potential objectives, such as minimizing the worst-case
      error, but the expected cost is special because it preserves the dynamic
      programming recursion: \[ J^*(s) = \min_a E \left[ \ell(s,a) + J^*(s')\right]
      = \min_a \left[ \ell(s,a) + \sum_{s'} \Pr(s'|s,a) J^*(s') \right].\]
      Remarkably, if we use these optimality conditions to construct our value
      iteration algorithm \[ \hat{J}(s) \Leftarrow \min_a \left[ \ell(s,a) +
      \sum_{s'} \Pr(s'|s,a) \hat{J}(s') \right],\] then this algorithm has the
      same strong convergence guarantees of its counterpart for deterministic
      systems.  And it is essentially no more expensive to compute!</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Stochastic interpretation of deterministic,
    continuous-state value iteration</h1>

      <p> There is a particularly cute observation to be made here. Let's assume
      that we have discrete control inputs and discrete-time dynamics, but a
      continuous state space.  Recall the fitted value iteration on a mesh
      algorithm described above. In fact, the resulting update is exactly the
      same as if we treated the system as a discrete state MDP with $\beta_i$
      representing the probability of transitioning to state $x_i$! This sheds
      some light on the impact of discretization on the solutions --
      discretization error here will cause a sort of diffusion corresponding to
      the probability of spreading across neighboring nodes.</p>

  <section><h1>Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)</h1></section>

  <section><h1>Linear Exponential-Quadratic Gaussian (LEQG)</h1>

    <p><elib>Jacobson73</elib> observed that it is also straight-forward to
    minimize the objective: $$J = E\left[ \prod_{n=0}^\infty e^{\bx^T[n] {\bf Q}
    \bx[n]} e^{\bu^T[n] {\bf R} \bu[n]} \right] = E\left[ e^{\sum_{n=0}^\infty
    \bx^T[n] {\bf Q} \bx[n] + \bu^T[n] {\bf R} \bu[n]} \right],$$ with ${\bf Q}
    = {\bf Q}^T \ge {\bf 0}, {\bf R} = {\bf R}^T > 0,$ by observing that the
    cost is monotonically related to $\log{J}$, and therefore has the same
    minima (this same trick forms the basis for "geometric programming"
    <elib>Boyd07</elib>). This is known as the "Linear Exponential-Quadratic
    Gaussian" (LEG or LEQG), and for the deterministic version of the problem
    (no process nor measurement noise) the solution is identical to the LQR
    problem; it adds no new modeling power.  But with noise, the LEQG optimal
    controllers are different from the LQG controllers; they depend explicitly
    on the covariance of the noise.  
      
    <todo>introduce the coefficient \sigma here, instead of just throwing it in
    from the start. The coefficient $\sigma$ in the objective is referred to as
    the "risk-sensitivity parameter" <elib>Whittle90</elib>.
    </todo>
    </p>

    <todo>Insert simplest form of the derivation here, plus an example.</todo>

    <p><elib>Whittle90</elib> provides an extensive treatment of this framework;
    nearly all of the analysis from LQR/LQG (including Riccati equations,
    Hamiltonian formulations, etc) have analogs for their versions with
    exponential cost, and he argues that LQG and H-infinity control can
    (should?) be understood as special cases of this approach.</p>

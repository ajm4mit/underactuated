<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Simple Models
of Walking and Running</h1>

  <p>Practical legged locomotion is one of the fundamental problems in robotics;
  we've seen amazing progress over the last few years, but there are still some
  fundamental problems.  Much of the recent progress is due to improvements in
  hardware -- a legged robot must carry all of its sensors, actuators and power
  and traditionally this meant underpowered motors that act as far-from-ideal
  force/torque sources -- but Boston Dynamics and other companies have made
  incredible progress here.  The control systems implemented on these systems,
  though, are still surprisingly heuristic -- they require dramatically higher
  bandwidth and lower latency that the human motor control system and still
  perform worse in challenging environments.<p>  
    
  <p>The control of walking robots is fundamentally underactuated -- assuming we
  cannot pull on the ground (and barring any aerodynamic effects!), then no
  matter how powerful my actuators are, there is nothing that they can do to
  accelerate the center of mass of the robot towards the ground faster than
  gravity.  But beyond the underactuated systems we have studied so far, the
  control of walking robots faces an additional complexity: <b>controlling
  through contact</b>.  The fact that we can get non-zero contact forces if and
  only if two bodies are in contact introduces a fundamentally
  discrete/combinatorial element into the problem&dagger;<sidenote>&dagger;I've
  had some interesting arguments with folks on this point, because it's possible
  to write contact models that smooth the discontinuity, and/or to model systems
  that have neglible collision events.  But replacing a discontinuity in the
  vector field with a stiff but smooth transition does not remove the need to
  decide whether or not your robot should make contact to accomplish a
  task.</sidenote>.</p>

  <p>Contact is fundamental for many aspects of robotics (manipulation is my
  other favorite example); it's sad to see so many robots going through life
  avoiding contact at any cost.  Controlling contact means that your robot is
  capable of performing physical work on the environment; isn't that the point
  of robotics, afterall?</p>

  <p>I like to start our discussion of contact with walking robots for a few
  important reasons.  As you'll see in this chapter, there are a number of
  elegant "simple models" of walking that capture much of the essence of the
  problem with minimal complexity.  But there is another, more subtle, reason: I
  want to continue to use the language of stability.  At this point we've seen
  both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon problem formulations -- when we can
  say something about the behavior of a system in the limit as time goes to
  infinity, it's almost always cleaner than a finite-time analysis (because time
  drops away).  Walking provides a very clean way to use the language of
  stability in studying behavior of systems that are sometimes in contact but
  sometimes out of contact in the limiting case; we just need to extend our
  notions from stability of a fixed point to the stability of a (periodic)
  cycle. 
  </p>

  <section><h1>Limit Cycles</h1>

    <p> A limit cycle is an periodic orbit that is a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_set">limit set</a> of the
    dynamical system; they can be stable (the limit set of neighboring
    trajectories as time goes to infinity) or unstable (the limit set of
    neighboring trajectories as time goes to negative infinity).  One of the
    simplest models of limit cycle behavior is the Van der Pol oscillator. Let's
    examine that first...</p>

    <example><h1>Van der Pol Oscillator</h1>

      <p>The Van der Pol oscillator is described by a second-order differential
      equation in one variable: $$\ddot{q} + \mu (q^2 - 1)\dot{q} + q = 0, \quad
      \mu>0$$ One can think of this system as almost a simple spring-mass-damper
      system, except that it has nonlinear damping.  In particular, the velocity
      term dissipates energy when $|q|>1$, and adds energy when $|q|<1$.
      Therefore, it is not terribly surprising to see that the system settles
      into a stable oscillation from almost any initial conditions (the
      exception is the state $q=0,\dot{q}=0$).  This can be seen nicely in the
      phase portrait below.</p>

      <figure>
        <table width="100%"><tr><td width="50%">
          <img width="100%" src="figures/vanderPol_phase.svg"/>
        </td><td width="50%">
          <img width="100%" src="figures/vanderPol_time.svg"/>
        </td></tr></table>
        <figcaption>System trajectories of the Van der Pol oscillator with $\mu
          =.2$. (Left) phase portrait.  (Right) time domain.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>However, if we examine system trajectories in the time domain (see the
      right panel of the figure above), then we can see that our traditional
      notion for stability of a trajectory, $\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} |\bx(t)
      - \bx^*(t)| = 0$, is not satisfied here for any $\bx^*(t)$. Although the
      phase portrait clearly reveals that all trajectories converge to the same
      orbit, the time domain plot reveals that these trajectories do not
      necessarily synchronize in time.</p>

    </example> <!-- end of VdP example -->

    <p>This example shows that stability of a trajectory (in time) is not the
    definition we want.  Instead we will define the stability of an orbit,
    $\bx^*(t)$, using \[ \min_\tau || \bx(t) - \bx^*(\tau) ||.\]  Here the
    quantity of interest is the distance between our trajectory and the
    <i>closest point</i> on the orbit.  Depending on exactly how this distance
    evolves with time, we can define <i>orbital stability</i>: for every small
    $\epsilon>0$, we can find a $\delta>0$ such that $\min_\tau||\bx(t_0) -
    \bx^*(\tau)|| < \delta$ implies $\forall t, \min_\tau ||\bx(t) -
    \bx^*(\tau)|| < \epsilon$).  The definitions for asymptotic orbital
    stability, exponential orbital stability, finite-time orbital stability
    follow naturally, as does the definition of an unstable orbit.  In the case
    of limit cycles, this $\bx^*(t)$ is a periodic solution with
    $\bx^*(t+t_{period}) = \bx^*(t)$. </p>

    <p>As we begin to extend our notions of stability, allow me to make a few
    quick connections to the discussion of stability in the <a
    href="lyapunov.html">chapter on Lyapunov analysis</a>.  It's interesting to
    know that if we can find an <a href="lyapunov.html#lasalle">invariant
    set</a> in state space which does not contain any fixed points, then this
    set must contain a closed orbit (this is the Poincar&eacute-Bendixson
    Theorem)<elib>Strogatz94</elib>.  It's also interesting to note that
    gradient potential fields (and Lyapunov functions with $\dot{V}(\bx) \prec
    0$) cannot have a closed orbit<elib>Strogatz94</elib>, and consequently we
    will also have to slightly modify the Lyapunov analysis we have introduced
    so far to handle limit cycles. We'll discuss this in some details in an <a
    href="limit_cycles.html#lyapunov">upcoming chapter</a>.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Poincar&eacute; Maps</h1>

      <p>The first tool one should know for analyzing the stability of a limit
      cycle, and one that will serve us quite well for the examples in this
      chapter, is the method of Poincar&eacute.  Let's consider a dynamical
      system, $\dot{\bx} = {\bf f}(\bx),$ with $\bx \in \Re^n.$  Define an $n-1$
      dimensional <em>surface of section</em>, $S$.  We will also require that
      $S$ is transverse to the flow (i.e., all trajectories starting on $S$ flow
      through $S$, not parallel to it).  The Poincar&eacute map (or return map)
      is a mapping from $S$ to itself:  $$\bx_p[n+1] = {\bf P}(\bx_p[n]),$$
      where $\bx_p[n]$ is the state of the system at the $n$th crossing of the
      surface of section. Note that we will use the notation $\bx_p$ to
      distinguish the state of the discrete-time system from the continuous-time
      system; they are related by $\bx_p[n] = \bx(t_c[n])$, where $t_c[n]$ is
      the time of the $n$th crossing of $S$.</p>

      <p>For our purposes in this chapter, it will be useful for us to allow the
      Poincar&eacute; maps to also include fixed points of the original
      continuous-time system, and to define the return time to be zero.  These
      points do not satisfy the transversality condition, and require some care
      numerically, but they do not compromise our analysis.</p>

      <example><h1>Return map for the Van der Pol Oscillator</h1>

        <p>Since the state space of this system is two-dimensional, a return map
        for the system must have dimension one.  For instance, we can take $S$
        to be the line segment where $q = 0$, $\dot{q} \ge 0$.  It is easy to
        see that all trajectories that start on S are transverse to it.</p>  
        
        <p>One dimensional maps, like one dimensional flows, are amenable to
        graphical analysis.
        </p>

        <figcaption>(Left) Phase plot with the surface of section, $S$, drawn
        with a black dashed line.  (Right) The resulting Poincar&eacute
        first-return map (blue), and the line of slope one (red).</figcaption>
        </figure>

      </example>

      <p>If we can demonstrate that ${\bf P}(\bx_p)$ exists for all $\bx_p \in
      S$, (all trajectories that leave $S$ eventually return to $S$), then
      something remarkable happens: we can reduce the stability analysis for a
      limit cycle in the original coordinates into the stability analysis of a
      fixed point on the discrete map.  If $\bx^*_p$ is a stable (or unstable)
      fixed point of the map ${\bf P}$, then there exists a unique periodic
      orbit $\bx^*(t)$ which passes through $\bx^*_p$ that is a (stable, or
      unstable) limit cycle.  If we are able to upper-bound the time it takes
      for trajectories leaving $S$ to return, then it is also possible to infer
      asympotitic orbital or even exponential orbital stability.</p>
      
      <p>In practice it is often difficult or impossible to find ${\bf P}$
      analytically, but it can be sampled quite reasonably numerically.  Once a
      fixed point of ${\bf P}$ is obtained (by finding a solution to$\bx^*_p =
      {\bf P}(\bx^*_p)$), we can infer local limit cycle stability with an
      eigenvalue analysis.  If this eigen-analysis is performed in the original
      coordinates (as opposed to the $n-1$ dimensional coordinates of $S$), then
      there will always be a at least one zero eigenvalue - corresponding to
      perturbations along the limit cycle which do not change the state of first
      return. The limit cycle is considered locally exponentially stable if all
      remaining eigenvalues, $\lambda_i$, have magnitude less than one,
      $|\lambda_i|<1$.</p>

      <p>It is sometimes possible to infer more global stability properties of
      the return map by examining ${\bf P}$.  We will study computational
      methods in the <a href="limit_cycles.html">later chapter</a>.
      <elib>Koditschek91</elib> describes some less computational stability
      properties known for <em>unimodal</em> maps which are useful for the
      simple systems we study in this chapter.</p>

      <p>A particularly graphical method for understanding the dynamics of a
      one-dimensional iterated map is the "staircase method":  Sketch the
      Poincar&eacute map -- a plot of $x_p[n]$ vs $x_p[n+1]$ -- and also the
      line of slope one.  In order to "iterate" the map, take an initial
      condition on the plot as a point $\left( x_p[k], x_p[k] \right)$, and move
      vertically on the plot to the point $\left( x_p[k], x_p[k+1] = f(x_p[k])
      \right)$.  Now move horizontally to the next point $\left( x_p[k+1],
      x_p[k+1] \right)$ and repeat.</p>

      <figure id="staircase">
        <img width="70%" src="figures/vanderpol_staircase.svg"/>
        <figcaption>The "staircase" on the return map of the Van der Pol
        Oscillator with $\mu = 0.2$, starting from two initial conditions
        ($\dot{q}_p[0] = .5$ and $\dot{q}_p[0] = 3.5$).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>We can quickly recognize the fixed points as the points where the
      return map crosses this line.  We can infer local exponential stability if
      the absolute value of the slope of return map at the fixed point is less
      than one ($|\lambda| < 1$). The figure above illustrates the stability of
      the Van der Pol limit cycle; it also illustrates the (one-sided)
      instability of the fixed point at the origin.  Understanding the regions
      of attraction of fixed points on an iterated map (or any discrete-time
      system) graphically requires a little more care, though, than the
      continuous-time flows we examined before.  The discrete maps can jump a
      finite distance on each step, and will in fact oscillate back and forth
      from either side of the fixed point when $\lambda < 0.$</p>

  <section><h1>Simple Models of Walking</h1>

    <p>Much of fundamental work in the dynamics of legged robots was done originally in the context of studying <i>passive-dynamic walkers</i> (often just "passive walker").  We've already seen my favorite example of a passive walker, in the first chapter, but here it is again:</p>

      </p>
      <figcaption>A 3D passive dynamic walker by Steve Collins and Andy Ruina<elib>Collins01</elib>.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This amazing robot has no motors and no controllers... it walks down a
    tiny ramp and is powered entirely by gravity.  We can build up our
    understanding of this robot in a series of steps.  As we will see, what is
    remarkable is that even though the system is passive, we believe that the
    periodic gait you see in the video is actually a stable limit cycle!</p>

    <p>Well before the first passive walkers, one of the earliest models of
    walking was proposed by McMahon<elib>McMahon80</elib>, who argued that
    humans use a mostly ballistic (passive) gait.  He observed that muscle
    activity (recorded via <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography">EMG</a>) in the
    "stance leg" is relatively high, but muscle activity in the "swing leg" is
    very low, except for at the very beginning and end of swing.  He proposed a
    "ballistic walker" model -- a three-link pendulum in the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane">sagittal plane</a>, with
    one link from the ankle to the hip representing a straight "stance leg", the
    second link from the hip back down to the "swing leg" knee, and the final
    link from the knee down to the swing foot -- and argued that this model
    could largely reproduce the kinematics of gait.  This model of "walking by
    vaulting" is considered overly simplistic today, as we now understand much
    better the role of compliance in the stance leg during walking.  His model
    was also restricted to the continuous portion of gait, not the actual
    dynamics of taking a step.  But it was the start.  Nearly a decade later,
    McGeer<elib>McGeer90</elib> followed up with a series of similarly inspired
    walking machines, which he coined "passive-dynamic walkers".</p>

    <subsection id="rimless_wheel"><h1>The Rimless Wheel</h1>

      <figure>
      <img width="40%" src="figures/rimlessWheel.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The rimless wheel. The orientation of the stance leg,
      $\theta$, is measured clockwise from the vertical axis. </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Perhaps the simplest possible model of a legged robot, introduced as
      the conceptual framework for passive-dynamic walking by
      McGeer<elib>McGeer90</elib>, is the rimless wheel.  This system has rigid
      legs and only a point mass at the hip as illustrated in the figure above.
      To further simplify the analysis, we make the following modeling
      assumptions:</p> <ul> <li>
      Collisions with ground are inelastic and impulsive (only angular momentum
      is conserved around the point of collision).</li> <li> The stance foot
      acts as a pin joint and does not slip.</li> <li> The transfer of support
      at the time of contact is instantaneous (no double support phase).</li>
      <li> $0 \le \gamma < \frac{\pi}{2}$, $0 < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2}$, $l >
      0$.</li> </ul>
      <p>Note that the coordinate system used here is slightly different than
      for the simple pendulum ($\theta=0$ is at the top, and the sign of
      $\theta$ has changed).</p> <todo> update the coordinates (here and in
      drake)</todo>

      <p> The most comprehensive analysis of the rimless wheel was done by
      <elib>Coleman98a</elib>.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Stance Dynamics</h1>

        <p>The dynamics of the system when one leg is on the ground are given by
        $$\ddot\theta = \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta).$$ If we assume that the system
        is started in a configuration directly after a transfer of support
        ($\theta(0^+) = \gamma-\alpha$), then forward walking occurs when the
        system has an initial velocity, $\dot\theta(0^+) > \omega_1,$ where
        $$\omega_1 = \sqrt{ 2 \frac{g}{l} \left[ 1 - \cos \left (\gamma-\alpha
        \right) \right]}.$$ $\omega_1$ is the threshold at which the system has
        enough kinetic energy to vault the mass over the stance leg and take a
        step.  This threshold is zero for $\gamma = \alpha$ and does not exist
        for $\gamma > \alpha$ (because when $\gamma > \alpha$ the mass is always
        ahead of the stance foot, and the standing fixed point disappears).  The
        next foot touches down when $\theta(t) = \gamma+\alpha$, at which point
        the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy yields the
        velocity $$\dot\theta(t^-) = \sqrt{\dot\theta^2(0^+) + 4\frac{g}{l}
        \sin\alpha \sin\gamma }.$$ $t^-$ denotes the time immediately before the
        collision.</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Foot Collision</h1>

        <figure> <img width="50%" src="figures/rimlessWheel_collision.svg"/>
        <figcaption>Angular momentum is conserved around the point of
        impact</figcaption> </figure>

        <p> The angular momentum around the point of collision at time $t$ just
        before the next foot collides with the ground is $$L(t^-) =
        -ml^2\dot\theta(t^-) \cos(2\alpha).$$ The angular momentum at the same
        point immediately after the collision is $$L(t^+) =
        -ml^2\dot\theta(t^+).$$ Assuming angular momentum is conserved, this
        collision causes an instantaneous loss of velocity: $$\dot\theta(t^+) =
        \dot\theta(t^-) \cos(2\alpha).$$</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Forward simulation</h1>

        <p>Given the stance dynamics, the collision detection logic ($\theta =
        \gamma \pm \alpha$), and the collision update, we can numerically
        simulate this simple model.  Doing so reveals something remarkable...
        the wheel starts rolling, but then one of two things happens: it either
        runs out of energy and stands still, or it quickly falls into a stable
        periodic solution.  Convergence to this stable periodic solution appears
        to happen from a huge range of initial conditions.  Try it yourself.</p>

        <example><h1>Numerical simulation of the rimless wheel</h1>

          <jupyter>examples/simple_legs.ipynb</jupyter>

          <p>I've setup the notebook to make it easy for you to try a handful of
          interesting initial conditions.  And even made an interactive widget
          for you to watch the simulation phase portrait as you change those
          initial conditions.  Give it a try!  (I recommend using Binder instead
          of Colab so you get the interactive features)</p>

          the more nuanced features of <drake></drake> in order to simulate the

          It actually registers the collision events of the system -- the
          simulator uses zero-crossing detection to ensure that the time/state
          of collision is obtained accurately, and then applies the reset
          map.</p>

          so much about.  So you will recognize the phase portraits of the
          system -- they are centered around the unstable fixed point of the
          simple pendulum.</p>
      </example>

      <subsubsection><h1>Poincar&eacute Map</h1>

        <p>We can now derive the angular velocity at the beginning of each
        stance phase as a function of the angular velocity of the previous
        stance phase. First, we will handle the case where $\gamma \le \alpha$
        and $\dot\theta_n^+ > \omega_1$.  The "step-to-step return map",
        factoring losses from a single collision, the resulting map is:
        $$\dot\theta^{+}_{n+1} = \cos(2\alpha) \sqrt{ ({\dot\theta_n}^{+})^{2} +
        4\frac{g}{l}\sin\alpha \sin\gamma}.$$ where the $\dot{\theta}^{+}$
        indicates the velocity just <em>after</em> the energy loss at impact has
        occurred.</p>

        <p>Using the same analysis for the remaining cases, we can complete the
        return map.  The threshold for taking a step in the opposite direction
        is $$\omega_2 = - \sqrt{2 \frac{g}{l} [1 - \cos(\alpha + \gamma)]}.$$
        For $\omega_2 < \dot\theta_n^{+} < \omega_1,$ we have
        $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = -\dot\theta_n^{+} \cos(2\alpha).$$ Finally, for
        $\dot\theta_n^{+} < \omega_2$, we have $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = -
        \cos(2\alpha)\sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 - 4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha
        \sin\gamma}.$$  Altogether, we have (for $\gamma \le \alpha$)
        $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = \begin{cases} \cos(2\alpha)
        \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 + 4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha \sin\gamma}, &
        \text{ } \omega_1 < \dot\theta_n^{+} \\ -\dot\theta_n^{+} \cos(2\alpha),
        & \text{ } \omega_2 < \dot\theta_n^{+} < \omega_1 \\ -\cos(2\alpha)
        \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 - 4\frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha \sin\gamma}, &
        \dot\theta_n^{+} < w_2 \end{cases}.$$ </p>

        <p>Notice that the return map is undefined for $\dot\theta_n = \{
        \omega_1, \omega_2 \}$, because from these configurations, the wheel
        will end up in the (unstable) equilibrium point where $\theta = 0$ and
        $\dot\theta = 0$, and will therefore never return to the map.</p>

        <p>This return map blends smoothly into the case where $\gamma >
        \alpha$. In this regime, $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = \begin{cases}
        \cos(2\alpha) \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 + 4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha
        \sin\gamma}, & \text{ } 0 \le \dot\theta_n^{+} \\ -\dot\theta_n^{+}
        \cos(2\alpha), & \text{ } \omega_2 < \dot\theta_n^{+} < 0 \\
        -\cos(2\alpha) \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 - 4\frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha
        \sin\gamma}, & \dot\theta_n^{+} \le w_2 \end{cases}.$$ Notice that the
        formerly undefined points at $\{\omega_1,\omega_2\}$ are now
        well-defined transitions with $\omega_1 = 0$, because it is
        kinematically impossible to have the wheel statically balancing on a
        single leg.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Fixed Points and Stability</h1>

        <p>For a fixed point, we require that $\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} =
        \dot\theta_n^{+} = \omega^*$.  Our system has two possible fixed points,
        depending on the parameters: $$ \omega_{stand}^* = 0,~~~ \omega_{roll}^*
        = \cot(2 \alpha) \sqrt{4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha\sin\gamma}.$$ The limit
        cycle plotted above illustrates a state-space trajectory in the vicinity
        of the rolling fixed point. $\omega_{stand}^*$ is a fixed point whenever
        $\gamma < \alpha$. $\omega_{roll}^*$ is a fixed point whenever
        $\omega_{roll}^* > \omega_1$.  It is interesting to view these
        bifurcations in terms of $\gamma$.  For small $\gamma$, $\omega_{stand}$
        is the only fixed point, because energy lost from collisions with the
        ground is not compensated for by gravity.  As we increase $\gamma$, we
        obtain a stable rolling solution, where the collisions with the ground
        exactly balance the conversion of gravitational potential to kinetic
        energy. As we increase $\gamma$ further to $\gamma > \alpha$, it becomes
        impossible for the center of mass of the wheel to be inside the support
        polygon, making standing an unstable configuration.</p>

        regions converge to zero velocity ($\omega_{stand}^*$).</figcaption>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Stability of standing still</h1>

        <p>I opened this chapter with the idea that the natural notion of
        stability for a walking system is periodic stability, and I'll stand by
        it.  But we can also examine the stability of a fixed-point (of the
        original coordinates; no Poincar&eacute this time) for a system that has
        contact mechanics.  For a legged robot, a fixed point means standing still.  It's a little subtle. [Coming soon.]</p>

    <subsection id="compass_gait"><h1>The Compass Gait</h1>

      <p>The rimless wheel models only the dynamics of the stance leg, and
      simply assumes that there will always be a swing leg in position at the
      time of collision.  To remove this assumption, we take away all but two of
      the spokes, and place a pin joint at the hip.  To model the dynamics of
      swing, we add point masses to each of the legs.  I've derived the
      equations of motion for the system assuming that we have a torque actuator
      at the hip - resulting in swing dynamics equivalent to an Acrobot
      (although in a different coordinate frame) - but let's examine the passive
      dynamics of the system first ($\bu = 0$).</p>

      <figure>
      <img width="45%" src="figures/compass_gait.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The compass gait</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In addition to the modeling assumptions used for the rimless wheel, we
      also assume that the swing leg retracts in order to clear the ground
      without disturbing the position of the mass of that leg. This model, known
      as the compass gait, is well studied in the literature using numerical
      methods <elib>Goswami96a+Goswami99+Spong03</elib>, but relatively little
      is known about it analytically.</p>

      <p>The state of this robot can be described by 4 variables:
      $\theta_{st},\theta_{sw},\dot\theta_{st}$, and $\dot\theta_{sw}$. The
      abbreviation $st$ is shorthand for the stance leg and $sw$ for the swing
      leg. Using $\bq = [ \theta_{st}, \theta_{sw} ]^T$ and $\bu = \tau$, we can
      write the dynamics as $$\bM(\bq)\ddot\bq + \bC(\bq,\dot\bq)\dot\bq =
      \btau_g(q) + \bB\bu,$$ with \begin{gather*} \bM = \begin{bmatrix}
      (m_h+m)l^2 + ma^2 & -mlb\cos(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw}) \\
      -mlb\cos(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw}) & mb^2 \end{bmatrix}\\ \bC =
      \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -mlb\sin(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw})\dot\theta_{sw} \\
      mlb\sin(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw})\dot\theta_{st} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
      \btau_g(q) = \begin{bmatrix} (m_hl + ma + ml)g\sin(\theta_{st}) \\
      -mbg\sin(\theta_{sw}) \end{bmatrix},\\ \bB = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1
      \end{bmatrix} \end{gather*} and $l=a+b$.</p>

      <p>The foot collision is an instantaneous change of velocity caused by a
      impulsive force at the foot that brings the foot to rest.  The update to
      the velocities can be calculated using the derivation for impulsive
      collisions <a href="multibody.html#impulsive_collision">derived in the
      appendix</a>.  To use it, we proceed with the following steps:</p>

      <ul> <li>Add a "floating base" to the system by adding a free (x,y) joint
      at the pre-impact stance toe, $\bq_{fb} =
      [x,y,\theta_{st},\theta_{sw}]^T.$</li> <li>Calculate the mass matrix for
      this new system, call it $\bM_{fb}$.</li> <li>Write the position of the
      (pre-impact) swing toe as a function $\bphi(\bq_{fb})$.  Define the
      Jacobian of this function: $\bJ = \frac{\partial \bphi}{\partial
      \bq_{fb}}.$</li> <li>The post-impact velocity that ensures that $\dot\bphi
      = 0$ after the collision is given by $$\dot\bq^+ = \left[ \bI -
      \bM_{fb}^{-1}\bJ^T[\bJ\bM_{fb}^{-1}\bJ^T]^{-1}\bJ\right] \dot\bq^-,$$
      noting that $\dot{x}^- = \dot{y}^- = 0$, and that you need only read out
      the last two elements of $\dot{\bq}^+$.  The velocity of the post-impact
      stance foot will be zero by definition, and the new velocity of the
      pre-impact stance foot can be completely determined from the minimal
      coordinates.</li> <li>Switch the stance and swing leg positions and
      velocities.</li> </ul>

      <example><h1>Numerical simulation of the compass gait</h1>

        <p>You can simulate the passive compass gait using:</p>

        <jupyter>examples/simple_legs.ipynb</jupyter>

        <p>Try playing with the initial conditions.  You'll find this system is
        <i>much</i> more sensitive to initial conditions than the rimless wheel.
        It actually took some work to find the initial conditions that make it
        walk stably.</p>

      </example>

      <p>Numerical integration of these equations reveals a stable limit cycle,
      plotted below.  Notice that when the left leg is in stance (top part of
      the plot), the trajectory quite resembles the familiar pendulum dynamics
      of the rimless wheel.  But this time, when the leg impacts, it takes a
      long arc around as the swing leg before returning to stance.  The impacts
      are also clearly visible as discontinuous changes (decreases) in velocity.
      The dependence of this limit cycle on the system parameters has been
      studied extensively in <elib>Goswami96a</elib>.</p>

      Drawn is the phase portait of the left leg angle, which is recovered from
      $\theta_{st}$ and $\theta_{sw}$ in the simulation with some simple
      book-keeping.</figcaption> </figure>

      <p>The basin of attraction of the stable limit cycle is a narrow band of
      states surrounding the steady state trajectory.  Although the simplicity
      of this model makes it analytically attractive, this lack of stability
      makes it difficult to implement on a physical device.</p>

    <subsection id="kneed_walker"><h1>The Kneed Walker</h1>

      <p>To achieve a more anthropomorphic gait, as well as to acquire better
      foot clearance and ability to walk on rough terrain, we want to model a
      walker that includes a knee<elib>Hsu07</elib>.  The mathematical modeling
      would be simpler if we used a single link for the stance leg, but we'll go
      ahead and use two links for each leg (and each with a point mass) because
      this robot can actually be built!</p>

      <figure>
      <img width="60%" src="figures/kneedwalker.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The Kneed Walker</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>At the beginning of each step, the system is modeled as a three-link
      pendulum, like the ballistic
      walker<elib>McMahon80+Mochon80+Spong03</elib>. The stance leg is the one
      in front, and it is the first link of a pendulum, with two point masses.
      The swing leg has two links, with the joint between them unconstrained
      until knee-strike. Given appropriate mass distributions and initial
      conditions, the swing leg bends the knee and swings forward. When the
      swing leg straightens out (the lower and upper length are aligned),
      knee-strike occurs. The knee-strike is modeled as a discrete inelastic
      collision, conserving angular momentum and changing velocities
      instantaneously.</p>

      <p>After this collision, the knee is locked and we switch to the compass
      gait model with a different mass distribution. In other words, the system
      becomes a two-link pendulum. Again, the heel-strike is modeled as an
      inelastic collision. After the collision, the legs switch instantaneously.
      After heel-strike then, we switch back to the ballistic walker's
      three-link pendulum dynamics. This describes a full step cycle of the
      kneed walker, which is shown above.</p>

      <figure>

      <figcaption>Limit cycle trajectory for kneed walker</figcaption>

      <p>By switching between the dynamics of the continuous three-link and
      two-link pendulums with the two discrete collision events, we characterize
      a full point-feed kneed walker walking cycle. After finding appropriate
      parameters for masses and link lengths, a stable gait is found. As with
      the compass gait's limit cycle, there is a swing phase (top) and a stance
      phase (bottom). In addition to the two heel-strikes, there are two more
      instantaneous velocity changes from the knee-strikes as marked in the
      figure. This limit cycle is traversed clockwise.</p>

  <section><h1>Simple Models of Running</h1>

    <p>Just like walking, our understanding of the dynamics and control of
    running has evolved by a nice interplay between the field of biomechanics
    and the field of robotics.  But in running, I think it's fair to say that
    the roboticists got off the starting blocks first.  And I think it's fair to
    say that it started with a series of hopping machines built by Marc Raibert
    and the Leg Laboratory (which was first at CMU, but moved to MIT) in the
    early 1980's.  At a time where many roboticsts were building relatively
    clumsy walking robots that moved very slowly (when they managed to stay
    up!), the Leg Laboratory produced a series of hopping machines that threw
    themselves through the air with considerable kinetic energy and considerable
    flair.</p>

    <p>To this day, I'm still a bit surprised that impressive running robots
    (assuming you accept hopping as the first form of running) appeared before
    the impressive walking robots.  I would have thought that running would be a
    more difficult control and engineering task than walking.  But these hopping
    machines turned out to be an incredibly clever way to build something simple
    and very dynamic.</p>

    <p>Shortly after Raibert built his machines, Dan Koditschek and Martin
    Buehler started analyzing them with simpler models
    <elib>Koditschek91</elib>.  Years later, in collaboration with biologist Bob
    Full, they started to realize that the simple models used to describe the
    dynamics of Raibert's hoppers could also be used to describe experimental
    data obtained from running animals.  In fact, they described an incredible
    range of experimental results, for animals ranging in size from a cockroach
    up to a horse<elib>Full99</elib> (I think the best overall summary of this
    line of work is <elib>Holmes06</elib>).  The most successful of the simple
    models was the so-called "spring-loaded inverted pendulum" (or "SLIP", for
    short).</p>  

    <subsection><h1>The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum</h1>

      <p>The model is a point mass, $m$, on top of a massless, springy leg with
      rest length of $l_0$, and spring constant $k$.  The state of the system
      is given by the $x,y$ position of the center of mass, and the length,
      $l$, and angle $\theta$ of the leg.  Like the rimless wheel, the dynamics
      are modeled piecewise - with one dynamics governing the flight phase, and
      another governing the stance phase.</p>

      <p>Flight Phase.  State variables: $\bx = [x,y,\dot{x},\dot{y}]^T.$
      Dynamics are $$\dot{\bx} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ 0 \\ - g
      \end{bmatrix}.$$</p>

      <p>Stance Phase. State variables: $\bx = [r, \theta, \dot{r},
      \dot\theta]^T.$ Kinematics are $$x = \begin{bmatrix} - r \sin\theta \\ r
      \cos\theta \end{bmatrix},$$ Energy is given by $$T = \frac{m}{2}
      (\dot{r}^2 + r^2 \dot\theta^2 ), \quad U = mgr\cos\theta +
      \frac{k}{2}(r_0 - r)^2.$$ Plugging these into Lagrange yields:
      \begin{gather} m \ddot{r} - m r \dot\theta^2 + m g \cos\theta - k (r_0 -
      r) = 0 \\ m r^2 \ddot{\theta} + 2mr\dot{r}\dot\theta - mgr \sin\theta = 0
      \end{gather}</p>

      <p>In this exercise we use trajectory optimization to identify a limit
      cycle for the compass gait.  We use a rather general approach: the robot
      dynamics is described in floating-base coordinates and frictional contacts
      are accurately modeled.  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/exercises/simple_legs/compass_gait_limit_cycle/compass_gait_limit_cycle.ipynb" target="_blank">In this notebook</a>,
      you are asked to code many of the constraints this optimization
      problem requires:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Enforce the contact between the stance foot and the ground at all
        the break points.</li>

        <li>Enforce the contact between the swing foot and the ground at the
        initial time.</li>

        <li>Prevent the penetration of the swing foot in the ground at all
        the break points. (In this analysis, we will neglect the scuffing
        between the swing foot and the ground which arises when the swing leg
        passes the stance leg.)</li>

        <li>Ensure that the contact force at the stance foot lies in the 
        friction cone at all the break points.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the impulse generated by the collision of the swing foot

Besides understanding in detail the dynamics of the hopping system, in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/exercises/simple_legs/one_d_hopper/one_d_hopper.ipynb" target="_blank">the notebook</a>, you are asked to write two pieces of code:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>A function that, given the state of the hopper, returns its total mechanical energy.</li>

        <li>The hopping controller class.  This is a <drake></drake> VectorSystem that, at each sampling time, reads the state of the hopper and returns the preload of the hopper spring necessary for the system to hop at the desired height.  All the necessary information for the synthesis of this controller are given in  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/exercises/simple_legs/one_d_hopper/one_d_hopper.ipynb" target="_blank">the notebook</a>.</li>
